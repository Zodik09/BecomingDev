// BMI Calculator Advanced (IF/ELSE)
// Previously, we've created a function that is able to calculate the BMI. But once we get a result, we will want to tell the user what the number means.

// Write a function that outputs (returns) a different message depending on the BMI.

// BMI <18.5, the output should be: "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are underweight."
// BMI 18.5-24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you have a normal weight."
// BMI >24.9, the output should be "Your BMI is <bmi>, so you are overweight."

// Solution
//Create your function below this line.
//The first parameter should be the weight and the second should be the height.

function bmiCalculator (weight, height) {
    var bmi =  Math.round(weight / Math.pow(height,2));
    if(bmi<18.5){
        return "Your BMI is " + bmi + ", so you are underweight."
    }
    if(bmi>18.5 && bmi < 24.9){
        return "Your BMI is " + bmi + ", so you have a normal weight."
    }
    if(bmi>24.9){
        return "Your BMI is " + bmi + ", so you are overweight."
    }
}
console.log(bmiCalculator(60, 1.62));
